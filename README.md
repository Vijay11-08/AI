# Artificial Intelligence 📚

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence** repository! 🎉 This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms on different datasets. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository will help you understand the practical implementation of popular machine learning techniques. 💡

## 📂 Project Overview

The repository includes the following Jupyter Notebooks:

- **DecisionTree_userdataset.ipynb**: 🌳 Applies a Decision Tree classifier to a user dataset. Helps in understanding how decision trees work for classification tasks.
- **KNN_mobiledataset.ipynb**: 📱 Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on a mobile dataset. A great example of how KNN can be used for classification based on similarity.
- **KmedoidsCluster_winedataset.ipynb**: 🍷 Performs K-Medoids clustering on a wine dataset. A clustering algorithm useful when you need a more robust alternative to k-means.
- **LogisticRegration_chddataset.ipynb**: ❤️ Implements Logistic Regression on a heart disease dataset. Demonstrates how logistic regression can be applied for binary classification tasks.
- **PCA.ipynb**: 🔍 Demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. A key technique to visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.
- **PuCluster_winedataset.ipynb**: 🍇 Applies a clustering algorithm to a wine dataset. Shows how clustering can be used for unsupervised learning tasks.
- **SVM_binary_multiclass_irisdataset.ipynb**: 🌸 Uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary and multiclass classification on the Iris dataset. A great example of SVM for both types of classification.
- **ensemble_learning_spambase.ipynb**: 📧 Employs ensemble learning techniques on the Spambase dataset. Combines multiple models to improve accuracy in detecting spam emails.
